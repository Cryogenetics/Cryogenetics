### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Astro Anticheat and a new project called Ludic.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my react skills.
- ðŸ’¼ I am currently looking for paid work.
- About me:
  I have been coding since i was around 9 years old, so about 10 years, most of which was spent making APIs, Bots, and Webapps in Node.JS.
  I mostly code APIs, bots and Webapps. I like to do backend mostly, but I also make fullstack applications time to time.
