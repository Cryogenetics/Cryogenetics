- About me:
```
I am 21 years old, and I am currently attending a university working towards a Bachelors degree in Computer Science

I have been coding since i was around 9 years old, so about 11 years.
most of which was spent making APIs, Bots, and Webapps in Node.JS. (~8ish years)

My main stack is Mongo Express Reactjs and Node, aka MERN
  
I mostly code APIs, bots and Webapps. I like to do backend, but I am a full-stack developer most of the time.

I have worked with many languages, but Node.JS is the one I am the most fluent in.
