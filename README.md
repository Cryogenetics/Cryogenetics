- About me:
```
I have been coding since i was around 9 years old, so about 10 years.
most of which was spent making APIs, Bots, and Webapps in Node.JS.
  
I mostly code APIs, bots and Webapps. I like to do backend mostly, but I also make fullstack applications time to time.

I have worked with many languages, but Node.JS is the one I am the most fluent in.
